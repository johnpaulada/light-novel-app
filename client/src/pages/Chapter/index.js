            Life has its fortunes and its hardships. I believe these words of
            the old man of Mito is a wise saying. Life has its mountains and
            valleys. It is exactly because one climbed over adversity that one

            soon find oneself surrounded by rising slopes. The conclusion is
            therefore, a person should persevere through lifeâ€™s climbs, but I
            think different.
